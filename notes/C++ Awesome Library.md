# C++ Awesome Library

## Mathematics

- [GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library(GMP)](): C++ class wrapper for GMP types. `gmpxx.h`
- [NTL: A Library for doing Number Theory(NTL)]():  a high-performance, portable C++ library providing data structures and algorithms for manipulating signed, arbitrary length integers, and for vectors, matrices, and polynomials over the integers and over finite fields.

## Memory Allocation
- [TCMalloc](https://github.com/google/tcmalloc): TCMalloc is Google's customized implementation of C's `malloc()` and C++'s operator `new` used for memory allocation within our C and C++ code. TCMalloc is a fast, multi-threaded malloc implementation.

## Unit Test
- [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest): Google Testing and Mocking Framework
- [google-benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark): A library to benchmark code snippets, similar to unit tests.

## Serialization

- [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal):  a header-only C++11 serialization library. cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. 

## Profile

- [gperftools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools): a collection of a high-performance multi-threaded malloc() implementation, plus some pretty nifty performance analysis
tools.
