I think The Old man and the Sea is the most useful book to me.

When I leaved my hometown and entered the collage, I found myself difficult to catch up with my peers and felt stressful. I consulted my class teacher about my concern and she was so kind that she gave me a novel named The Old Man and the Sea the next day.

This novel tells a story about an old fisherman who catches a huge Marlin after three days. However, this Marlin is eaten up by sharks on his way back. This vivid character shows us the kind, optimistic, and persistent spirits. Such characteristics truly help me find my potential and walk me through my difficulties in collage.

选择自己熟悉的城市Hong Kong, 为了增加细节, 可以无中生友来增加细节.

Tag: `city` `friend`

```
I often go to Hong Kong and Hong Kong is important to me, as one of my high school classmates, John, stdies in Hong Kong University. I have been to Hong Kong for several times and he often shows me around this city. John is Cantonese and he often introduces some brilliant Cantonnese restaurants to me, and I am quiet fascinated by Cantonese food, like Dim Sum and Kongfu tea. Another reason is that Hong Kong is an international dock and people from diverse conuntrites gather there. Therefore, the goods in Hong Kong are so cheap that I feel like looking for the latest digital products like iPhone and Macbook there.

> some college students choose to take courses in a variety of subject areas in oorder to get a broad education. Ohers choose to focus on a single subject area in order to have a deeper undertanding of that area. Which approach to course selection do you think is better for students and why.

2019年TOFEL后改革后, 独立口语去掉了Q1, 只保留了Q2, 变成只靠二选一或者agree或者disagree. 对于二选一, ETS并没有指出需要必须肯定或者否定, 一般来说可以两者分情况讨论.

Tag: `education` `wide vs specific`

此文本并不好, 存在过多的重复, 句式单调, 需要更改.

```
Well, it is a complicated question. I think it is important to know which stage you are in.
If you are a undergraduate student, It would be better to take courses in wide variety of subjects and different areas. Bacause it would expend the knowledge and improve the understanding of differrent topics.
On the other hand,  If you are a graduate student, you are suggested to take specific courses. Bcause if you are expolring in a specific science front, you have to focus on the latest advances in this area.

> Some likes to read fantastic literature, such as novel, and some likes to read documentary literature. Which one do you like?

Tag: `book`

感觉这里不太好都说喜欢, 如果从自己准备的database的熟悉程度出发的话, 选择fantastic literature比较好. 如果只选其中一个的话, 需要说出相对于另外一个的比较优势, 即get rid of the constraint of physical realistics and express the idea freely. 举具体例子的时候, 也需要比较一下.

| Time              | Memo                                                       |

```
Well, it is a complicated question, I prefer fantastic literature if I must choose one.
Bacause fantastic literure could get rid of the constraint of physical realistics and express the author's idea freely. Let me take an exmple. One of my favourite book, The Old Man and the Sea, tells a story about an old fisherman who catches a huge Marlin after three days. However, this Marlin is eaten up by sharks on his way back. This story can't happen in the real life, but this vivid character shows us the kind, optimistic, and persistent spirits. Such characteristics truly help me find my potential and walk me through my difficulties in collage.

```
Well, actually I like various types of movie, but I will select cartoon movie if I must choose one, bcause cartoon movie could get rid of the constraint of physical realistics and express the author's idea in a free way.  Let me take an exmple. One of my favourite cartoon movie, Coco, tells a story about a mexican boy who has a music dream but can't not get the understanding from his fimily. On the day of dead, he stepped into the underworld and find his grandfather, a singer. This story can't happen in the real life, but the characters truly inspirt our thinking about dream, family and love in a vivid way.

> Magazines, novels, verses which one do you like?

Tag: `book`

```
Well, actually I like various types of books, but I will select novels if I must choose one, for novels could inspirt your thinkings in a deeper way.  Let me take an exmple. One of my favourite book, The Old Man and the Sea, tells a story about an old fisherman who catches a huge Marlin after three days. However, this Marlin is eaten up by sharks on his way back. This vivid character shows us the kind, optimistic, and persistent spirits. Such characteristics truly help me find my potential and walk me through my difficulties in collage.

> Do you think the high school should teach music and art as other basic science?

Tag: `education` `art` `music`	

```
Yeah, I think music and art should be included in high school curriculum as other basic science. First, music and art can provide entertainment for people. If a person has learnt how to appreciate music and art, he would enjoy his life better.
Second, music and art present us with insight into the intenal and universal nature of humanity. In this sense, they are as important as other basic sciense. For example, Da Vinci's paintings contain the beauty of geometry.
What's more, the process of exploring music and art can develop students' creativity and their ability of expressing their own thoughts in a unique way. I think the inspirations from music and art can imporve people's creativity.
```

> Do you agree or disagree that government should suppourt museums and theaters?

Tag: `art` `meseum` `theather`

首先肯定是支持的. 然后分别讲一下mesuum和theater分别的优势是什么.

```
In my point of view, I totally aggree that that government should provide fund to build museums and theaters because they serve as exhibition centers for people to know about the history and culture of the country.
The range of museums is fantastic. There are museums of archaeology and natural history. 
And because the museums are constantly holding new exhibitions, there is always something different to see.
Theaters offer people a big place to enjoy a variety of operas and plays of different regions. Even the world's best group come occasionally.
Meanwhile, the building of the museums and theaters will enhance the cultural exchange between countries.

That's why I think it's a good idea for government to help with the building of museums and theaters.
```

> which one do you think is better to help do research, internet or academic books?

Tag: `technology` `book`

```
As far as I am concerned, I will choose Internet to do research.
To begin with, the Internet could provide me a tremendous amount of information and save me plenty of time. for example, You just need to enter a key word into Google search engine, and it will respond the information you need only in a few seconds, while you need to take a long time to search the information by using academic books.
Furthermore, it's more efficient and convenient to use the Internet; all you need is a computer, while carrying books around here and there can be very heavy. 
So I'd like to search the information all I need on the Internet.
```

> Do you prefer to communicate with your family and friends by letter and e-mail or by telephone?

Tag: `technology`

```

```



> Friends may disagree with each other, and still maintain friendship. Do you agree with or disagree with this idea, why？

Tag: `different` 

```
I totally agree with this idea.

Firstly, people are bound to be different. We have various family background as well as education background even though we are friends. So it is quiet common that we come up with different oponions toward one problem.

For example, I like watching the movie in the cinema, while my best friend John hates sitting in the dark place. But I never require him to go with me, and we are still very close friends.

Also, the friends who hold a diffrent attitude with me sometimes could inspire me to think from another way. Maybe a very sharp discussion my lead me to an inspiring idea. After all, the experiences and knowledge of one person is limited. 

For me, I like the friend who are different from me.
```



> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should receive money for doing household tasks such as cleaning.
>
> Use specific examples and details to support your opinion.

TPO 32 Q2

思路:

家庭责任: 孩子住在家里, 家长期望他们能够为家务做出一些贡献

培养对钱的概念: 孩子需要一些机会来学习和钱打交道，而零花钱是个学习财务管理的好机会

```
I totally agree the statement that children should receive money for doing household tasks such as cleaning,

bacause it can cultivate their responsibility for the familiy. Children are sometimes too lazy to do housework. However, as a family member, thay are expected to take their responsibility for the family. Getting paid could motivate them and help release the presure of their parents. 

Also, it can teach them the value of working for money. If the children get reward for doing housework, they will cherish the money more.

I used to be paid for washing the dishes for my parents. Although they didn't pay me much, I am more careful about how to spead it and it truly promote my financial awareness.
```

> Some people think that children should be allowed to watch whatever television programs they choose to. Others think that parents should exercise control over the television programs their children watch. Which do you agree with? Explain why. 

Tag: `technology`

思路:

1. 犯罪和暴力内容
2. 有吸引力 沉迷 视力

```
Personally, I think parents should supervise what their children watch on TV. The reasons are as follow.
Firstly, TV is always flooded with lots of criminal and violent scenes, which are especially bad for children. Parents should prevent them from watching those scenes because they might try to imitate the actions and put them into use.
Secondly, parents should also limit the amount of time children watch TV. Many TV programs are very addictive. With little self-control, children are likely to watch TV for a long period of time. In this way, they might end up having poor eyesight.
```

> Some students attend college full-time, while others attend college part-time. Which do you think is better? Explain why.

遇到不是具有很好说服理由的时候, 从个人出发. Well, I don’t think one is definitely better than the other, but personally speaking, I would prefer ...

```
Well, I don’t think one is definitely better than the other, but personally speaking, I would prefe attending college part-time.
Firstly,since the tuition and fees are very costly, I strongly suggest they find part-time jobs to share the financial burden with their parents.
Also, when I was in college, full-time school work made me very exhausted and stressful. I think students should be able to only choose certain amount of courses to take based on how much energy they have. They can always pick up the rest of the courses afterwards.
```

> Some students prefer to work on class assignments by themselves. Others believe it is better to work in a group. Which do you prefer? Explain why.

  ````
Well, it is a complicated question. But personally speaking, I prefer to work on assignments individually.
First of all, I like to be in a quiet place while studying. If I study in a group, I will easily be interrupted by other group members who talk about irrelevant things.
Furthermore,  I’d like to think independently. Studying individually can give me enough time to develop my own ideas. When studying in a group, I’m afraid I will be distracted by other’s opinions and thoughts.
Like last week	, I worked in a group to solve math problems. It turned out that many problems were solved by others not by myself. I felt very unhappy about it.
