# Homomorphic Computing Primer

## Background

description in a word: 

​	Homomorphic encryption is a tool that enables computation on encrypted data and thus has applications in privacy-preserving cloud computing.

component: 

​	encryption scheme(SHE/FHE) + additional routines <u>add</u> & <u>mult</u>



## Algorithm Scheme



## Implementation

- (SW) *FV-NFLlib*  from CryptoExperts
